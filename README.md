# OxygenNavs: a navbar theme for the OnePlus 5T

One of the first things I tried to do when I got my OnePlus 5T was rooting and theming it with Substratum. If you head over to the Google Play Store, you'll find your fair share of Substratum themes and mods revolved around OxygenOS, OnePlus' custom take on Android. However, they did one thing different with the OP5T flavor of OOS: instead of using the stock AOSP navbar we've all grown to love, OnePlus opted to go for a proprietary navigation bar.

Differences are noticeable at plain sight: the buttons themselves are closer together, resembling the EMUI navbar more closely than the AOSP one. As for the behavior, it's almost identical to that of Samsung: the default theme has a light grey theme with dark navigation buttons, in an attempt to prevent burn-in. Additionally, the navbar also has a (disabled by default) button which can show and hide the bar at any time, giving the user more screen real estate.

All these changes sound good and all, but they also mean that the navbar can't be themed by existing mods. I got behind the whole theming ordeal myself, cloned the Substratum template to my Windows computer, fired up Adobe Illustrator and started doing some designs. This started as a project made only for personal use, but I decided to do some additional designs and release this to the public to give something back to the community.

## What can I do with OxygenNavs?
At the moment, it's pretty barebones. There are 3 designs currently available: we have the default one, which is called ´Darch´. It's the one I originally made for myself using Illustrator, and it actually pre dates to some months back, as I originally made them in Photoshop for use with Resurrection Remix on my old phone. I want to make a standalone theme off this, but we'll see.

We also have ´samsung´, based off the Galaxy S8/Note8 navigation bar icons, and ´pixel´, based off the Pixel navbar (no animation, though). If you want to see a specific design ported over, be sure to suggest it to me on the XDA thread and I'll do my best!

In its current state, the app is pretty similar to zipalign's Navbars theme, only with way less designs and, of course, OP5T exclusivity. All theme sets are working completely flawlessly as of OxygenOS Open Beta 1, behaving just like the stock ones.
## Any features coming soon?
I have zero coding experience, and I don't know yet to what extent the 5T navbar can be modified. I do want to add things like custom background/button colors, custom spacing between buttons, and custom navbar height, but I have yet to dig deeper into the 5T's SystemUI. So, I can't promise anything until I'm sure it's possible.

What I can promise is that more button theme sets are coming. Since this uses SVG assets instead of the usual PNG assets found in the stock SystemUI, most button sets need to be remade using Illustrator or another design software before compiling and testing.
## Special thanks to:
* Coworkers, friends and family for giving me motivation to make this an actual thing.
* Team Substratum for making such an awesome theming engine (oh, and the template my theme is based off).
